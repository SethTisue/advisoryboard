# [Title of the Proposal]

## Proposer

Proposed by [Proposer], [Affiliation], [Date]

## Abstract

A description of the context in which this proposal is being made, clearly
describing the problems with the situation with reasons why it is considered
unsatisfactory.

## Proposal

A description of the activities that the Scala Center should perform, in order
to correct or mitigate the problems identified in the Abstract.

Where variations of the proposal exist, and the Advisory Board should
additionally make a choice about which variant should be adopted, those
variants should be listed here.

Note that the Scala Center will ascribe a three-digit number to the proposal at
the point it is merged into the repository, so there should be no need to
determine the next number in the sequence when making a proposal.

## Cost

An estimate of expected costs (if any) associated with implementing this
proposal, including both one-off and maintenance costs, if applicable. If the
costs are not known, uncertain, variable or dependent on other factors, this
should be described in this section.

## Timescales

An estimate of expected time required to implement this proposal. If the time
is not known, uncertain, variable or dependent on other factors, this should be
described in this section.
