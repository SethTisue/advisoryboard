# Scala Center Advisory Board Meeting, Q2, 2021: Agenda

# June 24, 2021

Dear AB Members,

I would like to officially welcome Kris and Databricks to the Advisory board! Yes, the paperwork is done 😊

As we meet on Monday, 28th June at 5 PM CEST, please read in detail:

1) The Scala Center Q2 (link, attached, or scroll down)
2) “Scala Community Management and Governance” strategy proposal (just attached)

I propose to leave at least 30 min time slot to go over the strategy proposal and get the Advisory board's opinion on how to move forward. We feel the pressure to start ASAP and ensure tangible results in this area by the end of 2021 and it is important to us to be in sync with you.

Looking forward to seeing you soon!
Best regards,
Darja
