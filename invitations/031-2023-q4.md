Hello Everyone,

I hope this reaches you all well, and that you've enjoyed the holiday season!
With the start of the new year it's again time to plan for the next advisory
board meeting. As I mentioned during the previous meeting, I'd like to plan the
full year of meetings just to make the process smoother, and also to allow
everyone to know the dates much sooner. Therefore I've gone ahead and made
multiple Doodle polls. Please take the time to answer each of them (I wasn't
able to do them all in one poll without a paid account, so forgive the multiple
polls).

Poll for Q4 of 2023

Poll for Q1 of 2024

Poll for Q2 of 2024

Poll for Q3 of 2024

Place answer them in a timely manner. I'll try to get the next meeting booked by
the end of next week. As always, don't hesitate to ask any questions, bring up
any points, or submit any proposals.

Best,

Chris

Hey Everyone,

I hope this reaches you all well. You should have received the invite for the
2023 Q4 AB meeting on Feb. 7th at 5pm CET. You can also find the link below:

As a reminder, please go and fill out the remaining Doodles for the other
meetings if you haven't. I plan on sending those invites out next week, but
wanted to give a bit more time for people to reply, since very few did.

The agenda will be forthcoming.

Chris
