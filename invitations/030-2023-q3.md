Hello Everyone,

I hope this reaches you all well! This last quarter seems to have flown by, and
it's time for another quarterly meeting. I've included the Doodle link to find a
time. Please try to respond by the end of this week. My goal is to solidify the
date and send out the invites next week.

Also note that during this meeting we'll be holding elections for the following:

- Chair
- Secretary
- Technical Advisor

So if you're interested in of these, please let me know.

Hello Everyone,

Just a quick reminder to please fill out the Doodle.  Only one of you have so
far, which makes planning quite difficult. I'll let this open another couple
days in order to get a bit more input before landing on a day.

Thanks!
