Hello Everyone!

I hope this reaches you all well! It's that time again, and we need to plan for
the Q1 advisory board meeting. I've gone ahead and created a Doodle for this
that you can find below:

Please fill it out as soon as you're able. As always, please do reach out if you
have anything you'd like to discuss or if you'd like something added to the
agenda. If you've been holding onto a proposal, now is also the time to submit
it.

Best,

Chris

Hello Everyone,

I wanted to send a quick reminder to fill out the doodle. There are very few
that have, which makes deciding on a time that works for the most quite
challenging. I plan on choosing the date at the end of Monday, so please make
sure to fill it out ASAP.

Hello Everyone,

Thanks to all of you that went ahead and filled out the doodle. We still had a
pretty small percentage of people that filled it out, so in order to really
ensure we can get as many people as possible attending in the future, please do
fill it out when it's sent.

The date for the next AB meeting will be April 25th at 5pm CEST. You should have
received a calendar invite, but you can also find the invite below:
