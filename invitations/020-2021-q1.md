Dear Scala Center Advisory Board members,

Please share your preference for the timing of our Q1 2020 board meeting by the end of this week here: (Doodle link)

After the delayed meeting for Q4 2020, we're working towards a more traditional quarterly schedule :-) (Note the gap in the options due to Easter holidays, however.)

cheers,
Adriaan
