2nd and final reminder: please fill out the poll if you haven't already â€” in just a few more days, we'll be picking a meeting date.

There is exactly one date everyone can make! So the next meeting will be on November 10, at the usual time. I'll send a calendar invite.

Reminder: we need to pick a new chair, since Adriaan is no longer available, and since at the last meeting we ran out of time to deal with it.

Since we're meeting on November 10, any new proposals should be submitted by November 3.

Seth
