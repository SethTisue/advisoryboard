Hello Everyone!

I hope this reaches you all well! As we’re wrapping up this year I thought it’d
be a good idea to get a date on the calendar right away for the Q4 advisory
board meeting in January. Please pay close attention to the time slots as this
time we have quite a few different options mainly due to us having attendees
literally all over the world. So let’s see what works best for everyone. My plan
is to finalise this date at the end of next week, so please respond as soon as
you can.

You can find the Doodle here: DOODLIEDO

I’m excited to take a look back at everything that was accomplished this past
year and also hopefully get lots of feedback about what the Center should focus
on this next year. Please feel free to reach out with any questions you may
have, or let me know if there is a topic you’d like on the agenda.

Best,

Chris Kipp

Hi Everyone,

Firstly, happy holiday season! I hope everyone either got or is in the middle of
getting some well-earned rest this holiday season. I’m always a fan of the end
of the year as it gives me a time to reflect on this past year and plan for the
next. Hopefully this next meeting will also provide that for us in the context
of Scala!

After looking at the (admittingly few) responses to the Doodle I’ve landed on
the 19th of January at 13:00 CET for our next meeting. I apologise in advance
for those that can’t make it due to the time, but again we have individuals from
around the globe attending this meeting.

You should have received an invite already, but you can also find the invite
below:

_INVITE THING_

The agenda will be forthcoming. Looking forward to digitally seeing you all!

Best,

Chris Kipp
