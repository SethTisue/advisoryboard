Hello Everyone,

I hope this reaches you all well! The time is upon us again where the next
advisory board meeting needs to be planned. I’ve included a Doodle to find the
time that works best for everyone. Please do fill it out as soon as possible. I
aim to finalise the date by the end of next week, the 9th.

A few other items that I’d like to make everyone aware of.

- As stated by the Scala Center Membership Regulations (Article 4), the elected
    officers serve for a period of one year. Meaning that this next meeting
    we’ll need to have elections for Chairperson, Technical Advisor, and
    Secretary. Please do consider whether you feel you may be a good fit for one
    of these roles. As a reminder, those currently elected can also stand again.
- As mentioned at the previous meeting, we’d like to start hearing a bit more
    from companies. Therefore, I plan on reaching out to a couple of you to give
    a small recap of the happenings at your company related to Scala. When I
    reach out I’ll provide more detailed information on this.
- The small committee has gathered and slimmed down the list of recommendations
    for community representatives to 6 individuals and forwarded them to the
    Center for them to consider for the open community chairs. Since it’s
    unknown if those will be in place or not by the next meeting, please do let
    me know if there are any community concerns or points you’d like brought up
    during the next meeting as I do plan on having a “community input” section
    to the agenda. Many thanks for those of you that put names forward.

As always, don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions and let me know if
you’d like something added to the agenda. I look forward to the next meeting.

Chris
