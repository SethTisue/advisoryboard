# SCP-014: Production ready scalamacros/scalamacros

## Proposer

Proposed by 47 Degrees and SAP. Prepared with help from Eugene Burmako
and Olafur Pall Geirsson.

## Abstract

Def macros and macro annotations have become an integral part of the
Scala 2.x ecosystem. Well-known libraries like Play, sbt, Scala.js,
ScalaTest, Shapeless, Slick, Spark, Spire and others use macros to
achieve previously unreachable standards of terseness and type safety.

Unfortunately, Scala macros have also gained notoriety as an arcane
and brittle technology. The most common criticisms of Scala macros
concern their difficult metaprogramming API based on compiler
internals as well as a lack of featureful editor support. Even five
years after their introduction, traditional macros don’t expand
properly in Intellij. This leads to a proliferation of spurious “red
squiggle” errors, even in simple projects. As a result of these
problems the language committee has decided to retire the current
macro system in Dotty (Scala 3.x).

During the last couple years a new macro system has been developed to
support both Scala 2.x and Dotty. The new system is based on the
platform-independent metaprogramming API Scalameta, which is designed
to be easy to use and easy to support across multiple implementations
of the Scala language. The result of this multi-year effort is hosted
at https://github.com/scalamacros/scalamacros and its design is
explained in detail in the paper
[“Two approaches to portable macros”][gestalt]

This repository is currently a working prototype of the new macro
system that features:

- Scalameta based syntactic and semantic APIs that cross-compile
  against Scala 2.12, 2.13 and Dotty. The corresponding library is
  quite slim, being less than 500Kb in size.
- A prototype implementation of the new macro engine for Scala 2.12.3
  that supports macro annotations and def macros.

No one is currently employed to work on scalamacros/scalamacros. This
means that the project relies on volunteer effort to reach a
production-ready status.

## Proposal

We propose that the Scala Center invests engineering resources to make
scalamacros/scalamacros production ready so the community can migrate
to this new macro system. This will ultimately enable better IDE
support and ease migration to Dotty.

Focus should be put on the following tasks:

- Finalize support for macro annotations with coverage for
  class/trait/object/def definitions and modifiers.
- Finish support for def macro materializers with full coverage for
  types. This includes support for the functionality provided by
  legacy whitebox macros-- specifically allowing def macros to inspect
  types at the macro call site and return values of types not known
  before macro expansion.
- Provide documentation for using the new macro system. This includes
  a migration guide from legacy macros, potentially with scalafix
  rewrites.


## Cost & Timescales

We expect each of these items to require a minimum one month
effort. Combined, we expect 4 to 5 months of a full-time hired
engineer.

The project should be completed by March 2018.
