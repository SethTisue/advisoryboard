# Community Delegate Terms

## Proposer

Proposed by Rob Norris and Bill Venners, community members, 3-Jan 2022.

## Abstract

Section 3.2 of the [_Regulations For The Scala Industry Affiliates Program_](https://scala.epfl.ch/docs/ScalaCenterMembershipRegulations.pdf) provides for the appointment of community delegates, as follows:

> Community Delegate. The Executive Director may appoint an individual from the broader Scala community to serve on the Advisory Board. The Community Delegate is eligible to be elected as an Officer in accordance with Section 4.2 of these Regulations.

This provision grants broad latitude to the Executive Director to select (and presumably dismiss) community delegates, which we feel is appropriate. However it is our sense that new voices are as important as old and trusted ones, and in recognition of this we wish to recommend that the Executive Director adopt the custom of appointing community delegates for staggered terms of two years.

## Proposal

This is an informal recommendation that does not require changes to the Scala Center's official regulations. We propose the following:

- Community delegates will be appointed for terms of two years. Reappointment is permitted.
- Terms will be staggered such that community delegates step down at regular intervals, not all at once.
- Community delegates who are serving at the time this recommendation is adopted will remain on the Advisory Board until replaced, reappointed, or asked to step down.
