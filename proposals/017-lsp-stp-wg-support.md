# Scala Center Support for LSP and STP Working Groups

## Proposer

Proposed by Stu Hood, Eugene Burmako - Twitter - March 2018.

## Abstract

The ecosystem for Scala's tooling (in particular, IDE integration and build tooling)
has been beset for many years by a lack of coherence and coordination between
different tooling projects.

The newly-created LSP Working Group (LSP-WG) and Scala Tooling Protocols Working Group (STP-WG)
offer a unique opportunity to unite developers and users of tooling for Scala
around common solutions which will help to define and stimulate an exciting
new tooling ecosystem for Scala.

## Proposal

The Scala Center should devote developer time and resources to supporting
the work of the LSP-WG and STP-WG in kickstarting Scala's tooling ecosystem,
through contributions which ensure a dependable level of quality of documentation,
test coverage and reliability of key projects identified by or arising from the
working groups.

## Costs

There should be no direct costs associated with this proposal.

## Timescales

The required input should be 5 developer-days per week, split between
the two working groups, and dependent on developer availability, for one year.
