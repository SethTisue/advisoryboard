# SCP-003: Scala Center Publicity Chair

## Proposer

Proposed by Alexy Khrabrov, Nitro, May 9, 2016

## Abstract

Publicity Chair role for Scala Center is proposed to coordinate and foster
community stewardship, Scala Center growth, and Scala community growth and
alignment.

## Proposal

One of the key functions of Scala Center is to drive Scala based on the
community needs and visions.  Scala consists of multiple tribes, and
technological alignment is achieved by constant communication.  Furthermore, as
an organization, Scala Center depends on enterprise support.  Carefully
calibrated and properly executed communication strategy is required to achieve
this.  I propose the role of the Publicity Chair and raise my hand to drive it
forward.

## Cost

The functions of my role at Nitro align well with this role.  The costs would
be marketing outreach (campaigns), design of infographics, etc.  A PR strategy
would need to be created and costs evaluated.

## Timescales

PR plan would be put forward at the next board meeting.
