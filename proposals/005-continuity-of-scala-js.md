# SCP-005: Ensurance of continuity of Scala.js project

## Note

This text is a post-hoc summary of the proposal as verbally presented during
the First Scala Center Advisory Board Meeting.

## Proposer

Proposed by Alexy Khabrov from Nitro

## Proposal

The proposal is for the Scala Center to ensure continuity of
the Scala.js project, resources permitting.

Background: At present (May 2016), the core Scala.js project members
are SÃ©bastien Doereane and Nicolas Stucki.  The funding for Stucki's
position runs out in August.

Could Scala.js yet be considered "production ready", "enterprise
ready", "bulletproof", and so forth?  Some companies, including some
large companies, already think so.  But if not, what it would take to
get it there?  Issues the Scala.js project don't have resources to
address right now include: IDE support, integration between backend
and frontend code, and integration with JavaScript ecosystem (such as
npm and ES6 modules and libraries).  Scala.js does a good job in
dealing with JavaScript the language, but there isn't a good story yet
of managing dependencies coming from both ecosystems (e.g. with
bower).
