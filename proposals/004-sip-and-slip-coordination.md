# SCP-004: Center to coordinate SIP/SLIP process

## Note

This text is a post-hoc summary of the proposal as verbally presented during
the First Scala Center Advisory Board Meeting.

## Goals

 - Regain community's trust and enthusiasm for the SIP/SLIP process.
 - Increase the community's involvement with the language and the eco-system.
 - Fair representation of community, industry and language creator &
   maintainers.

## Proposed approach

 - We can't fix this until we admit there's a problem. For example, just
   mentioning SIP/SLIP on a PR will immediately shut down the conversation.
 - Minimize process overhead, clarify timing of deadlines, responsibility of
   various actors.
 - Should we rebrand the process? It may help to have separate technical
   working groups that come up with proposals and a separate process for voting
   on these proposals. We could integrate the latter into the Scala Center
   board meetings.
