# SCP-025: Use of Inclusive Language

## Proposer

Proposed by Daniela Sfregola, representing Morgan Stanley, September 15, 2020.

## Abstract

As technical professionals, we often use metaphors to describe concepts. The use of terms such as master-slave and whitelist-blacklist is problematic because it carries connotations of oppression and discrimination against minorities. Moreover, such terminology is not an accurate description of what it tries to represent.

The Scala Center should take action and adopt a more inclusive language in all its platforms. Avoiding oppressive terminology will offer the following benefits: firstly, it will make the Scala ecosystem more welcoming to underrepresented groups in tech; secondly, it will improve clarity in communications and documentation by avoiding terminology that is confusing and non-accurate.

This proposal does not attempt to define a list of forbidden terms nor tries to propose alternatives from them: the Scala Center should identify them and discuss them case by case.

## Proposal
The Scala Center should undertake the following (non-exhaustive) list of actions:

### Discuss and Identify Oppressive Terms
The Scala Center should discuss a list of oppressive terms to avoid.

### Replacing Oppressive Terms
The Scala Center should identify the use of such terms and discuss a replacement for them (when possible) on a case by case basis.

Some example actions to address them could include:

**Code Changes**
- Create pull requests for the projects maintained by the Scala Center to propose an alternative to the offensive term.
- Change their structure if needed, such as branch names and CI configuration

**Documentation**
- Revise their documentation and replace the oppressive language where possible and without compromising its understanding.

### Actively Encourage the Use of Inclusive Language
The Scala Center should avoid using the identified oppressive language in all future communications, both on its Forum and Social Media.

It should also encourage its members and contributors to adopt a more inclusive language.

## Cost
This project is a long-term commitment to encourage inclusive language in all communications and projects from the Scala Center.

Initially, resources will be needed to change the existing code, infrastructure, and documentation: this will vary depending on the identified oppressive terms.

## Timescales
Given the open scope of this proposal, we are unable to suggest a required time for it. However, we believe that the discussion to identify the offensive terms should happen sooner rather than later.
