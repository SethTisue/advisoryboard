Meeting are typically by videoconference, but sometimes physical when
a convenient opportunity arises for a majority of attendees, for
example at a Scala conference.  We aim to meet in-person at
least once a year.

## Other Attendees

The Scala Center may also invite other attendees to be present in meetings,
particularly in order to provide information or advice on particular agenda items.
