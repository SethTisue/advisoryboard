# Advisory Board Meeting Attendees

The Scala Center Advisory Board meets every quarter.

Meeting are typically by video-conference, but sometimes physical when
a convenient opportunity arises for a majority of attendees, for
example at a Scala conference.  We aim to meet in-person at
least once a year.

## Officers

 - Chairperson: Chris Kipp
 - Secretary: Seth Tisue
 - Executive Director: Darja Jovanovic
 - Technical Director (interim): SÃ©bastien Doeraene
 - Technical Advisor: Martin Odersky

We customarily rotate the position of chairperson annually.

## Sponsors

Each Advisory Board Sponsor nominates a representative to the board.
(Sometimes two, to ensure coverage; but they share one vote.)

The current representatives are:

 - Lightbend: Lukas Rytz
 - Morgan Stanley: Daniela Sfregola
 - VirtusLab: Krzysztof Borowski
 - JetBrains: Dmitrii Naumenko

## Community Members

Individuals may also be selected to sit on the board to represent the Scala
community. Currently, this is:

 - Zainab Ali
 - Eugene Yokota

## Other Attendees

The Scala Center may also invite other attendees to be present in meetings,
particularly in order to provide information or advice on particular agenda items.
